# Composer dependency analyser

This package aims to detect shadowed composer dependencies in your project, fast!
See comparison with existing projects:

| Project                                                                               | Analysis of 13k files |

## Installation:

```sh
composer require --dev shipmonk/composer-dependency-analyser
```

## Usage:

```sh
composer dump-autoload -o # we use composer's autoloader to detect which class belongs to which package
vendor/bin/composer-dependency-analyser src
```

Example output:
```txt

Found shadow dependencies!
(those are used, but not listed as dependency in composer.json)

  • Nette\Utils\Json (nette/utils)
  • Nette\Utils\JsonException (nette/utils)
  • Symfony\Contracts\Service\Attribute\Required (symfony/service-contracts)

```

You can add `--verbose` flag to see first usage of each class.

## Shadow dependency risks
You are not in control of dependencies of your dependencies, so your code can break if you rely on such transitive dependency and your direct dependency will be updated to newer version which does not require that transitive dependency anymore.

Every used class should be listed in your `require` (or `require-dev`) section of `composer.json`.

## Future scope:
- Detecting dead dependencies
- Detecting dev dependencies used in production code

## Limitations:
- Files without namespace has limited support
  - Only classes with use statements and FQNs are detected

## Contributing:
- Check your code by `composer check`
- Autofix coding-style by `composer fix:cs`
- All functionality must be tested
